# The "Unbeatable Song Hack"

Most likely the first mod menu for the Unbeatable DEMO.

To use, download MelonLoader ( https://melonwiki.xyz/ ) and put a .dll of this mod into the Mods folder. A GUI should pop up in the game now.

Depending on whether this mod is released, you can find a .dll file on the [releases page](https://github.com/ErikGXDev/unbeatable-demo-song-hack/releases).

### Developing this

If you want to work on this, you should most likely replace the `<GamePath>` directory in `UnbeatableSongHack.csproj` with your path to the game (the path where the game executable is located).
